Yes—think in **architectural epics** that unlock multiple features at once. Here’s a tight plan that maps to your MVP but scales to the full editor. Each epic has: **scope**, **why it pays rent**, **deliverables**, and **acceptance tests**.

---

# 0) You’ve finished: Platform Skeleton ✅

* Tauri+React scaffold, one IPC command, packaged .app works.

---

# 1) Media Intake & Catalog

**Scope:** import → probe → (optional) thumbnail/proxy → catalog.
**Why:** Everything depends on reliable assets with known duration/size/fps.
**Deliverables**

* Drag-drop + file picker.
* Rust `probe_media(path)` returns `{durationMs,width,height,fps,sizeBytes}`.
* Asset store (id, abs path, metadata).
* (Optional) `make_thumbnail(path, atMs)`; (Stretch) `make_proxy(path,720p)`.
  **Acceptance**
* Import 5 mixed files; durations match ffprobe; thumbnails render.
* Handles spaces/non-ASCII paths.

**Interfaces**

* `invoke("open_dialog") → paths[]`
* `invoke("probe_media",{path}) → meta`
* `invoke("make_thumbnail",{path,atMs}) → thumbPath`

---

# 2) Timeline Core & Editing Primitives

**Scope:** timeline data model + pure ops.
**Why:** Non-destructive editing = everything is cheap JSON transforms.
**Deliverables**

* Data types: `Asset`, `Clip{assetId,inMs,outMs,startMs}`, `Track[]`.
* Operations: **place**, **move**, **trim (in/out)**, **split at playhead**, **delete**.
* Selection model + keyboard bindings (←/→ move playhead, `S` split).
* (Optional) **snap** to clip edges / grid.
  **Acceptance**
* Can arrange 3+ clips; trim edges; split and delete; state stays valid (no overlaps on same track unless allowed).

**Interfaces**

* Pure functions only (no IPC): `insertClip`, `moveClip`, `trimClip`, `splitClip`, `serializeProject()`

**Teaching intuition**

* Treat this as a **CRDT-ish pure core**. If the UI crashes, your JSON remains the truth.

---

# 3) Preview Engine (“Interpreter”)

**Scope:** real-time preview of the current frame/time.
**Why:** Proves the editor *feels* like an editor before export exists.
**Deliverables**

* Playhead + time ruler; scrubbing.
* Compute `(clip, localTime)` from `t`.
* **HTML5 `<video>`** preview: swap sources when crossing clip boundaries; set `currentTime` to `localTime`.
* (Optional) pre-buffer next clip; (Optional) proxy playback toggle.
  **Acceptance**
* Smooth scrub across clip seams; play/pause works; audio stays in sync for single-track sequence.

**Interfaces**

* `mapTimelineTimeToClip(t) → {assetId, localMs} | null`
* `<PreviewPlayer src={asset.path} timeMs={localMs} />`

**Intuition**

* You’re writing a tiny **interpreter** for your timeline. Export later is the **compiler**.

---

# 4) Export Compiler (FFmpeg)

**Scope:** deterministic render from project JSON → MP4.
**Why:** This is the MVP “proof you can ship video”.
**Deliverables**

* Segment generator: for each clip → temp file with `-ss/-to`.
* Concat list writer.
* `export_concat({listFile,outPath,reencode,jobId})` (Rust) with progress events.
* Progress UI parses `time=hh:mm:ss.xx`.
* Fallback: if `-c copy` fails, auto re-encode.
  **Acceptance**
* 2-minute timeline, mixed sources → MP4 at 720p/1080p; no crash; progress increments; output plays correctly.

**Interfaces**

* `invoke("export_prepare",{project,workdir}) → {segPaths,listFile,totalMs}`
* `invoke("export_concat",{args})` + listen `export://jobId`

**Stop-rules**

* If heterogenous codecs cause concat errors, **always normalize** segments to H.264/AAC.

---

# 5) Project Persistence & Recovery

**Scope:** save/open, autosave, crash-safe.
**Why:** You can iterate without fear; enables undo/redo later.
**Deliverables**

* Project file (`.clipforge.json`) with relative paths + version header.
* Autosave every N sec to `AppData/tmp/<projectId>.bak`.
* On startup: detect stale backups and offer recovery.
  **Acceptance**
* Kill the app mid-edit → reopen → restore from autosave with no data loss.

**Interfaces**

* `saveProject(project, path)`
* `loadProject(path) → project`
* `autosave(project)`

---

# 6) Diagnostics & Guardrails

**Scope:** structured errors, logs, health checks.
**Why:** Media toolchains fail in weird ways; you need visibility.
**Deliverables**

* Rust `thiserror` + JSON error envelope (`code`, `message`, `hint`).
* Log file rotation to `AppData/Logs`.
* “Check FFmpeg” button (`bins()` OK? versions?).
  **Acceptance**
* Unavailable ffmpeg → friendly modal with “Install/Locate FFmpeg” action.

---

# 7) Recording Stack (Post-MVP, but architected now)

**Scope:** screen, webcam, mic; save to timeline.
**Why:** Needed for full submission, but decoupled from core.
**Deliverables**

* **Phase 1:** WebView APIs: `getDisplayMedia`, `getUserMedia` + `MediaRecorder` → `.webm`.
* **Phase 2 (stretch):** Native capture in Rust for system audio/window selection quirks.
* Auto-import recorded file as new asset; drop at playhead.
  **Acceptance**
* Record 30s screen capture → appears in media panel → plays → export works.

**Interfaces**

* UI: `startScreenRecord() / stopScreenRecord() → path`
* Later Rust: `start_native_capture(args) → id`, events: `record://id`, `stop_native_capture(id)`

---

## Dependency Graph (build in this order)

1. **Media Intake** → 2) **Timeline Core** → 3) **Preview** → 4) **Export** → 5) **Persistence** → 6) **Diagnostics** → 7) **Recording**.

This sequence gives you a usable editor (import/arrange/trim/preview/export) before touching recording.

---

## Cross-cutting “done” bar (keep it strict)

* **Pure functions** for timeline ops (unit-testable).
* **No blocking** on Tauri main thread; long jobs stream progress events.
* **Absolute paths** internally; project file stores **relative** paths to project directory.
* **One source of truth**: project JSON; Rust reads it but doesn’t mutate it.

---

## Intuition to guide decisions

* **Compiler mindset:** Preview = interpreter; Export = compiler. Keep the “IR” (your project JSON) small and crisp.
* **Normalize early:** Media heterogeneity is the #1 time sink. Normalize segments and move on.
* **Events, not awaits:** Desktop work is long; progress events keep the UI honest and responsive.
* **Invest in timeline purity:** A great timeline core makes every feature (transition, PiP, undo/redo) a small extension rather than a rewrite.
