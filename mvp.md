This is a hard gate. To pass the MVP checkpoint, you must have:

Desktop app that launches (Electron or Tauri)
Basic video import (drag & drop or file picker for MP4/MOV)
Simple timeline view showing imported clips
Video preview player that plays imported clips
Basic trim functionality (set in/out points on a single clip)
Export to MP4 (even if just one clip)
Built and packaged as a native app (not just running in dev mode)
