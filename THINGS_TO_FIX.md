-Scrubbing fails if we reach the end of a clip, but if there are multiple clips, I can scrub back to the first one and it seems to reset something , allowing scrubbing to work again - curious
-properly bundle ffmpeg and ffprobe in the app, so we don't need to install them separately
- audio sync on webcam recording is off
- audio non existent on combined recording
